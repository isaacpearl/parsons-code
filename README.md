# parsons-code
This program takes valid [Parsons code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsons_code, "Parsons code wikipedia article"), a starting pitch, and a step size as input, and outputs a sequence of pitches that represent the melody encoded as Parsons code. Currently, the sequence is printed as pitch classes with no octave register specified, and defaults to the C Major scale.
